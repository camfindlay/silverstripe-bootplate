# Bootplate
Bootplate is a mashup of the best parts from Bootstrap and Boilerplate that combines them in to a SilverStripe theme. This is ideal for development - clone to your new project and then take it from there.

It's designed to save time and to do the bare minimum to get your frontend ready for development, so nothing here should need to be edited (much) to move forward with your app's design.

## Todo:
1. Figure out how to get minification without requiring its definition inside Controller::init
2. Remove bloat

## Instructions
1. Copy default/ directory to themes
2. Enjoy
